Two robots land with their parachutes on an infinite one-dimensional number line. They both release their parachutes as soon as they land and start moving. They are allowed only to make use of the following functions.

I. moveLeft() // robot moves to left by 1 unit in 1 unit time

II. moveRight() // robot moves to right by 1 unit in 1 unit time

III. noOperation() // robot does not move and takes 1 unit time

IV. onTopOfParachute() // returns true if the robot is standing on top of either of the parachute, else false

V. didWeMeet() // returns true if the robot meets to the other robot, else false

Write a function in order to make the robots meet each other. Robots will be executing the same copy of this function.

Answer:
Follow this pattern moveLeft() 1 time, moveRight() 2 times, moveLeft() 3 times and so on. In each iteration, the robot will go over itâ€™s own parachute one time. But after certain time, one robot will go over its own parachute and also parachute of another robot. At this point, it has met with the other robot.
